# calculator
A calculator that will be used in a webpage, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project will require some HTML and CSS knowledge to make the webpage appear as a basic calculator program would appear. The main purpose of this project to further my understanding of JavaScript.

I will further my understanding of the DOM to make all the buttons work and display the results in a div window. I will learn more about javaScripts Arrays and objects through their implementation as I'm aware they are needed to finish this project.
