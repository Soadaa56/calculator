I would like to return to this project to make the page 'beautiful' with CSS and change Javascript to use a Calculator class<br /><br />

A calculator that will be used in a webpage, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br />

This project will require some HTML and CSS knowledge to make the webpage appear as a basic calculator program would appear. The main purpose of this project to further my understanding of JavaScript.<br />

I will further my understanding of the DOM to make all the buttons work and display the results in a div window. I will learn more about javaScripts Arrays and objects through their implementation as I'm aware they are needed to finish this project.<br />
